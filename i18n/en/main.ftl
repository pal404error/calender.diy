admin-room-pattern-warning = Without <code>{"{"}random{"}"}</code> the room name is predictable: two guests booking the same event type on the same day end up sharing a room and can see each other's meeting. Stable rooms are allowed (e.g. one personal room per host), but only enable this if you understand the trade-off.
admin-meeting-webhook-help = When an event type's location is set to "Webhook (custom provider)", TrueNorth Bookings POSTs the booking payload to this URL on confirmation and expects a JSON body <code>{"{"}"url": "https://..."{"}"}</code> back.

Only <code>CALRS_SMTP_HOST</code> and <code>CALRS_SMTP_FROM_EMAIL</code> are required; omit the username and password to relay through a local MTA without authentication.
admin-sms-env-error-help = Fix the <code>CALRS_SMS_*</code> environment variables, or unset them to manage SMS from the database here.
admin-sms-env-managed = Managed via <strong>environment variables</strong> (overrides the database). Edit the <code>CALRS_SMS_*</code> variables to change it, or unset them to manage SMS from here.
admin-sms-env-help = Alternatively, configure via environment variables (which override this): <code>CALRS_SMS_PROVIDER</code>, <code>CALRS_SMS_API_KEY</code>, <code>CALRS_SMS_API_SECRET</code>, <code>CALRS_SMS_SENDER</code>, <code>CALRS_SMS_BASE_URL</code>, <code>CALRS_SMS_DAILY_CAP</code>, <code>CALRS_SMS_DEFAULT_COUNTRY_CODE</code>.
admin-sms-trial-warning = <strong>Twilio trial mode is on</strong> (<code>CALRS_SMS_TWILIO_TRIAL</code>).
